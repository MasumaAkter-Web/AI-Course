#  Coin Subtracting Game: 

##  Overview
A strategic turn-based coin game where the player competes against an unbeatable AI powered by the *Minimax algorithm*.  
- Total coins: 15  
- Players take turns removing **1, 2, or 3 coins** from the pile  
- Built with Python and Pygame  
- Interactive GUI with buttons and visual coin representation  

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed  
2. Install Pygame via terminal/command prompt: `pip install pygame`  
3. Save the code as `coin_game_ai.py`  
4. Run the game: `python coin_game_ai.py`  
5. The game window will open, ready for play  

##  How to Play
1. Click on a button labeled 1, 2, or 3 to remove that many coins from the pile  
2. The AI will automatically respond with its optimal move  
3. The player who is forced to take the last coin *loses*  
4. Press *R*to reset the game at any time  

##  Algorithm Used
*Minimax Algorithm* ensures the AI makes optimal decisions:  
- MAX player: AI tries to maximize its chances of winning  
- MIN player: Human tries to minimize AI advantage  
- Recursively evaluates all possible future moves to select the best one  
- Guarantees that the AI never loses if played optimally  

##  Software & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame  
- Minimax AI logic implemented in Python  

Coin Subtracting Game offers a simple yet challenging experience, testing your strategic thinking.  
The AI uses perfect play, making every game a test of planning and foresight.
